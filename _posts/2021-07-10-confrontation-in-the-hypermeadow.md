##### *Confrontation in the HyperMeadow*, Audience Interacting with AR Scene, Screenshot, Tri Space, Shanghai 2021
##### A collaboration among Mingxuan Xie, Jamey Braden and FREQS

Confrontation in the HyperMeadow explores embodiment, selfhood, and the possibility of experiences to echo and resonate through different planes of reality. It is a story of an ordinary cyborg the physical world who is stuck in a dream loop, or a time loop or a life loop. She finds herself in a virtual world that is fed by AI, poems, and dreams. Creatures speaking in riddles appear to guide her but where will they lead?

{"prompt": ["A narcissus blooms brightly in the dark, begging you to open a window"]}
{"result": ["The darkness that ever whispered to you is that 
             dream is real when you dream. 
             And you might not believe it, 
             and you might not believe it as long as you keep your paper 
             and don’t let the curtains under your skin. 
             Dream is perhaps a tale.
             when you look up at the sky,
             you could see a white pair of dream.
             Sometimes, when you dream of faces in the night 
             you could not believe that your dream is a real dream when you dream. 
             But when you look up at the sky you could not believe 
             everything you said for me that i never knew 
             and that was a perfect dream. 
             You didn’t know me i never knew it.  
             Everything you said for me that i never knew  
             I just thought you would always remember that 
             I could  always remember you 
             and you can see the dream of a perfect dream perfect above you 
             and you can see the dream of a perfect face without dream."]}
