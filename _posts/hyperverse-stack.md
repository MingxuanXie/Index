title: "超宇宙技術棧 ｜ HyperVerse Stacks"
categories:
---

The pandemic forced the whole world being virtualized towards the metaverse at a booming speed.

My practice has long been investigating the body-space relationship between atoms and bits, 
like my previous works HyperSite and HyperBody.

HyperSite is the combination of website and physical site 
where bodies meet spaces 
both virtually and physically.

HyperBody is the physical body augmented by cyber organs
 like smartphones and vr headsets, 
 and also includes its virtual avatars.

Inspired by Benjamin Bratton's "The Stack" 
and Marcos Novak's "Next Babylon", 
I propose the HyperVerse Stacks project for this summer session as a further development of HyperSite and HyperBody. 

The goal is to build a fully working HyperVerse system
 including both hardware and software stacks.

I will build a network server with a crypto mining node at the residency space to power the virtual exhibition.

I will also 3D scan the residency space to recreate a digital twin on blockchain. The web-based digital twin will enable
offline visitors and online avatars to interact with each other.

All the hardware and software stacks, 
including the source code, 
the network relationships 
and the user activities 
would be fully exposed and displayed as the final exhibition. 

In oder to achieve the "hyper" status beyond existing metaverse, 
the whole system would be open sourced, 
allowing users to modify each stack or even build their own.

I am Mingxuan Xie, a cyberspace architect.

Thank you!

Inspired by Benjamin Bratton's "The Stack" and Marcos Novak's "Next Babylon", Mingxuan Xie will use web server, crypto mining, IoT devices, 3d scan and WebVR technology to build a HyperVerse prototype in conjunction with the provided residency space and its context. It will create a blockchain-powered digital twin of the physical residency space, allowing people to visit both online and offline as well as interacting with each other. Each stack of the HyperVerse will be fully open-source, exposed and displayed as the final exhibition in both virtual and physical spaces.
