The architectural theorist Rem Koolhaas mentioned in his book "Elements of Architecture" that "doors", as a formerly complex element, are increasingly being dematerialized with the aid of various new technologies and are gradually becoming a hindrance to the increasing demand for mobility, transparency, and accessibility in contemporary society. However, in the Metaverse, the "doors" are already dematerialized and need rich details to emphasize their existence, while also serving a connecting function rather than a hindering one. "The Elements of Vrchitecture" is a series of experimental projects by the VrchStudio that attempts to define the basic building blocks of virtual space while exploring their narrative potentials. In this project, AI-generated "doors" become a unique hyperlink that breaks down the boundaries between physical and virtual spaces, continuously reconstructing the spatial relationships in the Metaverse.

庫哈斯《建築的元素》中提到，“門”作為曾經非常複雜的元素現在各種新技術的幫助下越來越去物質化，並逐漸成為當前社會越來越追求流動性、透明性與可達性的阻礙。而在元宇宙中本身就是非物質化的“門”卻正相反，不僅需要豐富的細節來強調自身的存在，同時起到的也是連接而非阻礙的作用。《維筑的元素》是未亓工作室嘗試定義虛擬空間的基本構建元素，並探索其微敘事的一系列實驗項目。而本次以AI算法實時生成的“門”，則成為了打破物理空間與虛擬空間的“超鏈接”，並將不斷重構元宇宙的空間關係。
