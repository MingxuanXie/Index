The Vrchitecture Builder is a metaverse space generator modded from a game engine. It tracks the body movement data from the visitors and uses the data to generate new virtual spatial experiences in real time. Visitors can remix various virtual elements to add up different layers of perceptions; in the meantime, they need to control the virtual avatar via their own body movement to adapt to the constantly changing space to explore the recursive relationship between the physical body and the virtual space. It stands for the QWAN (Quality Without A Name) in the metaverse – this quality cannot be designed directly, but generated through participants’ natural actions. 

維築構造器（The Vrchitecture Builder）是一個用遊戲引擎魔改而成的元宇宙空間生成引擎，它以實時捕捉觀眾的肢體動作數據的方式，不間斷地生成新的虛擬空間體驗。一方面，觀眾可以自由混合並重組不同的虛擬元素，疊加不同層次的感知；另一方面，觀眾受到其虛擬化身所在空間的影響，需要實時通過自己的肢體動作去操作化身，以應對空間的流變。這最終探索的是肉身與虛擬空間緊密關聯的遞歸結構，它標誌著元宇宙建築的「無名特質」——這種品質不可被直接設計，只能由使用者的自然行為產生。
